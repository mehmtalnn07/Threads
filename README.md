# You can change the package name in the project code, but you need to do this in all files of the project. You can use your own package name. 

# Here are the steps:

# 1.⁠ ⁠Sign up for Firebase and log in.
# 2.⁠ ⁠After logging in, create a new Firebase project. You can choose any name for the project.
# 3.⁠ ⁠Download a JSON file for the project using your package name. The file will be named ⁠ google-service.json ⁠, and you should not change its name.
# 4.⁠ ⁠Open Android Studio and open your project.
# 5.⁠ ⁠Add the downloaded ⁠ google-service.json ⁠ file to the ⁠ app ⁠ folder in your project directory.
# 6.⁠ ⁠Go back to Firebase and enable Authentication, Realtime Database, Firestore Database, and Storage services.
# 7.⁠ ⁠Set up rules for each service according to your needs.

# Now, your project can communicate with Firebase, and you can develop it as you like. Happy coding!
